**Chests Anywhere** is a [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/) mod which lets you access
your chests, fridge, Junimo huts, and shipping bin from anywhere and organize them your way.
Transfer items without having to run around, from the comfort of your bed to the deepest mine level.

## Install
1. [Install the latest version of SMAPI](https://smapi.io/).
3. Install [this mod from Nexus mods](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/518).
4. Run the game using SMAPI.

## Use
**Access chests** by pressing `B`. This will show your chests grouped by category. Navigate by
clicking the top dropdowns, or by pressing the `left` or `right` key.

**Edit chests** by clicking the edit icon after opening a chest ([see example](screenshots/animated-edit.gif)).
This will show a form where you can...
* set the chest name;
* set a category (which defaults to its location);
* set the sort order in the chest list;
* or hide the chest from the chest list.

**Point at a chest** in the world to see its name in a tooltip.

**Open the shipping bin** to view the items in the shipping bin. This lets you retrieve items
before they're shipped overnight. (You can ship any number of items, but only the first 36 will be
visible in the UI.)

## Configure
### In-game settings
If you have [Generic Mod Config Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098) installed,
you can click the cog button (⚙) on the title screen or the "mod options" button at the bottom of
the in-game menu to configure the mod. Hover the cursor over a field for details, or see the next
section.

### `config.json`
The mod creates a `config.json` file in its mod folder the first time you run it. You can open that
file in a text editor to configure the mod.

These are the available settings:

<table>
<tr>
  <th>setting</th>
  <th>what it affects</th>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><code>Range</code></td>
  <td>

Default `Unlimited`. The range at which chests are accessible. The possible options are...

* `Unlimited`: all chests.
* `CurrentWorldArea`: chests in the current world area, based on these areas: beach, bus stop,
  desert, farm, forest, mine, mountain, railroads, town, witch swamp.
* `CurrentLocation`: chests in the current location.
* `None`: can't remotely access any chest.

  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><code>Controls</code></td>
  <td>

The configured controller, keyboard, and mouse buttons (see [key bindings](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Key_bindings)).
The default button bindings are...

action | keyboard | controller
------ | -------- | ----------
toggle chest UI | `B` | _none_
switch chest | `Left`, `Right`<br />or `LeftControl` + scroll mouse wheel | `LeftShoulder`, `RightShoulder`
switch category | `Up`, `Down`<br />or `LeftAlt` + scroll mouse wheel | `LeftTrigger`, `RightTrigger`

You can separate bindings with commas (like `B, LeftShoulder` for either one), and set multi-key
bindings with plus signs (like `LeftShift + B`).

  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><code>ShowHoverTooltips</code></td>
  <td>

Default `true`. Whether to show the chest name in a tooltip when you point at a chest.

  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><code>EnableShippingBin</code></td>
  <td>

Default `true`. Whether to allow access to the shipping bin through Chests Anywhere.

  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><code>DisabledInLocations</code></td>
  <td>

The locations in which to disable remote chest lookups. You can use the
[Debug Mode mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/679) to see the name of any in-game
location, or get the location name for a chest from its edit screen. You can use
`"UndergroundMine"` to match any level of the mines or skull caverns (except the entrance itself).

  </td>
</tr>
</table>

## Compatibility
Chests Anywhere is compatible with Stardew Valley 1.5+ on Linux/Mac/Windows, both single-player and
multiplayer.

Multiplayer notes:
* There's no problem with some players not having the mod.
* If you're not the main player, you can only access chests in synced locations (usually the farm, farmhouse, constructed farm buildings, and your current location). This is due to limitations in how the game syncs data.

## Mod integrations
### Get overlay info
You can access Chests Anywhere's mod-provided API to get info about its menu overlay (i.e. the UI
it floats over the chest UI). For example:

```cs
var api = helper.ModRegistry<IChestsAnywhereApi>("Pathoschild.ChestsAnywhere");
if (api != null)
{
    bool isOverlayOpen = api.IsOverlayActive();
    bool isOverlayInterceptingInput = api.IsOverlayModal();
}
```

See [mod-provided APIs](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/APIs/Integrations#Mod-provided_APIs)
on the wiki for more info.

### Setting chest options
Chests Anywhere stores its options in each chest's `modData` field. You can add them explicitly to
set the options yourself (e.g. to hide chests that shouldn't appear in the dropdowns).

Here are the recognized options:

`modData` key | description
------------- | -----------
`Pathoschild.ChestsAnywhere/Name` | The chest name. Defaults to a name like "Chest #7".
`Pathoschild.ChestsAnywhere/Category` | The category name. Defaults to the location name.
`Pathoschild.ChestsAnywhere/IsIgnored` | Set to `true` to hide the chest from the dropdowns. Defaults to `false`.
`Pathoschild.ChestsAnywhere/Order` | An integer sort order in the dropdowns, relative to other chests. Defaults to 0.
`Pathoschild.Automate/StoreItems`<br />`Pathoschild.Automate/TakeItems` | How Automate stores/takes items in the chest. The possible values are `Allow` (_store/take items in this chest_), `Prefer` (_store/take items in this chest first_), or `Disabled` (_never store/take items in this chest_). Defaults to `Allow`.
`Pathoschild.Automate/PreventRemovingStacks` | Set to `true` to prevent Automate from removing the last item in a stack. Default `false`.
