### `config.json` file
The mod creates a `config.json` file in its mod folder the first time you run it. You can open that
file in a text editor to configure the mod.

Here's what you can change:

* You can choose how fast each animation runs. Each value is a multiple of the original speed, like
  `1` for normal speed or `2` for double speed. This can also be a fractional value like `1.5`.
