## 1.19.1
Released 04 January 2021 for SMAPI 3.8.0 or later.

  `chest.GetActualCapacity()` method in 1.5 instead.
* Automate previously stored automation options in the chest name using tags like
  `|automate:no-store|`. These are now stored in the new `chest.modData` field added in 1.5; existing
  chests will be migrated automatically.
