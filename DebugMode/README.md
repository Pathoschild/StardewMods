### Game debug mode
If you enable `AllowGameDebug` in the [configuration](#configuration) (disabled by default), the
mod will also enable the game's debug mode and hotkeys:

hotkey | action | multiplayer notes
:----- | :----- | -------------------
`T`    | Add one hour to the clock. | Main player only, affects all players.
`SHIFT` + `Y` | Subtract 10 minutes from the clock. | Main player only, affects all players.
`Y`    | Add 10 minutes to the clock. | Main player only, affects all players.
`1`    | Warp to the mountain (facing Robin's house). | Affects current player.
`2`    | Warp to the town (on the path between the town and community center). | Affects current player.
`3`    | Warp to the farm (at your farmhouse door). | Affects current player.
`4`    | Warp to the forest (near the traveling cart). | Affects current player.
`5`    | Warp to the beach (left of Elliott's house). | Affects current player.
`6`    | Warp to the mine (at the inside entrance). | Affects current player.
`7`    | Warp to the desert (in Sandy's shop). | Affects current player.
`K`    | Move down one mine level. If not currently in the mine, warp to it. | Affects current player.
`F5`   | Show or hide all player sprites. | Visible to current player.
`F7`   | Draw a tile grid. | Visible to current player.
`F8`   | Show a debug command input window (not currently documented). | Depends on the command used.
`B`    | Shift the toolbar to show the next higher inventory row. | Affects current player.
`N`    | Shift the toolbar to show the next lower inventory row. | Affects current player.

If you also enable `AllowDangerousCommands` in the configuration (disabled by default), you can
also use these debug hotkeys:

hotkey | action | multiplayer notes
:----- | :----- | -----------------
`P`    | Immediately go to bed and start the next day. | Affects current player. Will take effect when you change location.
`M`    | Immediately go to bed and start the next season. | Affects all players if used by main player; else equivalent to `P`. Will take effect when you change location.
`H`    | Randomize the player's hat. | Affects current player.
`I`    | Randomize the player's hair. | Affects current player.
`J`    | Randomize the player's shirt and pants. | **Affects all players!**
`L`    | Randomize the player. | **Affects all players!**
`U`    | Randomize the farmhouse wallpaper and floors. | Affects main player's farmhouse (even if used by another player).
`F10`  | Starts a multiplayer server for the current save (if not already started). | No meaningful effect.

## Configure
The mod creates a `config.json` file in its mod folder the first time you run it. You can open that
file in a text editor to configure the mod.

These are the available settings:

setting           | what it affects
:---------------- | :------------------
`Controls`        | The configured controller, keyboard, and mouse buttons (see [key bindings](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Key_bindings)). You can separate multiple buttons with commas. The default value is `~` to toggle debug mode.
`AllowGameDebug` | Default `false`. Whether pressing the key also enables the [game's built-in debug mode](#game-debug-mode).
`AllowDangerousCommands` | Default `false`. This allows game debug commands which end the current day/season & save, randomize your player or farmhouse decorations, or crash the game. Only change this if you're aware of the consequences.

## Compatibility
Debug Mode is compatible with Stardew Valley 1.4+ on Linux/Mac/Windows, both single-player and
multiplayer. Commands may have different effects in multiplayer; see multiplayer notes for each
command.
