## Install

2. ~~Install this mod from Nexus mods~~.
3. Run the game using SMAPI.

## Use
Just press `F11` (configurable) to toggle noclip mode. When it's enabled, nothing can stop you.

## Configure
The mod creates a `config.json` file in its mod folder the first time you run it. You can open that
file in a text editor to configure the mod.

These are the available settings:

| setting           | what it affects
| ----------------- | -------------------
| `ToggleKey`    | The controller/keyboard/mouse button which toggles noclip mode (see [key bindings](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Key_bindings)). You can separate multiple buttons with commas. The default keyboard binding is `F11`.

## Compatibility
Noclip Mode is compatible with Stardew Valley 1.4+ on Linux/Mac/Windows, both single-player and
multiplayer (even if other players don't have it). No known mod incompatibilities.
