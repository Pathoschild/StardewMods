* Optimized token updates to reduce in-game lag for some players.

## 1.26.6
Released 05 June 2022 for SMAPI 3.14.0 or later.

## 1.26.3

## 1.26.2
Released 15 May 2022 for SMAPI 3.14.0 or later.

* Optimized performance and memory allocation:

  * Removed unneeded array copies.
* Fixed error when passing a null input to the `LowerCase`/`UpperCase` or `Render` tokens.

* Added [`AnyPlayer` option](author-guide/tokens.md#target-player) for player tokens.
