Released 16 August 2020 for SMAPI 3.6.0 or later. See the [release highlights for mod authors](https://www.patreon.com/posts/40495753).

* Patches can now optionally [update on location change](author-guide.md#update-rate), including all tokens (not only location-specific tokens).
* Patches can now resize maps automatically using `Action: EditMap` (just patch past the bottom or right edges).
* Added `TargetPathOnly` token (the target field value for the current patch, without the filename).
* Added [`patch reload`](author-guide.md#patch-reload) console command (thanks to spacechase0!).
* Added troubleshooting hints related to update rate in `patch summary` console command.
* Removed legacy token API obsolete since Content Patcher 1.12.
* Fixed ambiguous-method detection in advanced API.
* Internal changes to prepare for realtime content updates.

**Update note for mod authors:**  
If you use the `LocationName` or `IsOutdoors` token/condition, updating the `Format` field to
`1.17.0` or later requires changes to your `content.json`. See the
[migration guide](author-migration-guide.md) for more info.

Released 08 August 2020 for SMAPI 3.6.0 or later.

* Fixed some patches not applied correctly in 1.16.

## 1.16.0
Released 02 August 2020 for SMAPI 3.6.0 or later. See the [release highlights for mod authors](https://www.patreon.com/posts/40028155).

* Added [an `Include` action](author-guide.md#include) to load patches from another JSON file. That includes full token support, so you can load files dynamically or conditionally.

**Update note for mod authors:**  
Using `"Action": "EditData"` with a `FromFile` field is now deprecated, though it still works.
Migrating to an `"Action": "Include"` patch is recommended; it's more flexible and works more
intuitively. (That doesn't apply to `"Action": "EditData"` patches without a `FromFile` field.)
