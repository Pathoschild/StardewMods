# Release notes
## Upcoming release
* Fixed token subkey form not allowed in boolean fields.
* Updated for change in the upcoming SMAPI 3.0.

## 1.6.1
* Fixed error when a content pack has a patch with no `Target` field.
* Fixed some conditions using subkeys marked invalid incorrectly.

## 1.6
* Added new tokens:
  * `DaysPlayed`: the number of in-game days played for the current save.
  * `HasWalletItem`: the [special items in the player wallet](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Wallet).
  * `SkillLevel`: the player's level for a given skill.
* Added `Wind` value for `Weather` token.
* Added support for matching subkey/value pairs like `"Relationship": "Abigail:Married, Marnie:Friend"`.
* Added support for conditional map edits (via SMAPI 2.9).
* Added support for editing `Data\NPCDispositions` after the NPC is already created (via SMAPI 2.9).
* Improved performance for most content packs.
* Improved `patch summary` format.
* Updated for the upcoming SMAPI 3.0.
* Fixed language token always marked 'not valid in this context'.
* Fixed token strings not validated for format version compatibility.
* Fixed some 1.5 tokens not validated for format version compatibility.

**Update note for mod authors:**
* The `Weather` token now returns `Wind` on windy days instead of `Sun`. Existing content packs with `"Format": "1.5"` or earlier should work fine, since Content Patcher will adjust their conditions. Content packs which target version 1.6 or later should handle the new weather value.

## 1.5.3
* Added `patch summary` hint if `Target` value incorrectly includes a file extension.
* Migrated verbose logs to SMAPI's verbose logging feature.
* Fixed yet another error setting `EditData` entries to `null` since 1.5.

## 1.5.2
* Improved `patch summary` output a bit.
* Fixed another error setting `EditData` entries to `null` since 1.5.

## 1.5.1
* Added token support in `EditData` keys.
* Fixed error setting `EditData` entries to `null` since 1.5.
* Fixed error using tokens in `Enabled` field since 1.5.

## 1.5
* Added support for dynamic tokens defined by the modder.
* Added new tokens:
  * `FarmCave` (the current farm cave type);
  * `FarmhouseUpgrade` (the upgrade level for the main farmhouse);
  * `FarmName` (the farm name);
  * `FarmType` (the farm type like `Standard` or `Wilderness`);
  * `HasFile` (whether a given file path exists in the content pack);
  * `HasProfession` (whether the player has a given profession);
  * `PlayerGender` (the player's gender);
  * `PlayerName` (the player's name);
  * `PreferredPet` (whether the player is a cat or dog person);
  * `Year` (the year number).
* Added subkey form for all tokens, which can be used to enable AND logic and condition negation (see readme).
* Added: you can now use any condition with `Action: Load` patches.
* Added: you can now use tokens in `EditData` entries and fields.
* Added: you can now list multiple values in the `Target` field.
* Added config tokens to `patch summary`.
* Added warning when a config field has `AllowValues` but a patch checks for an unlisted value.
* Removed some early warnings for issues like patch conflicts. That validation required a number of
  restrictions on how conditions and tokens could be used. Based on discussion with content pack
  modders, lifting those restrictions was more valuable than the early validation.
* Removed image preloading, which is no longer needed with SMAPI 2.8+.
* Fixed `patch summary` showing tokens that aren't valid in the current context.
