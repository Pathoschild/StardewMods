# Release notes
## 1.15
Released 04 July 2020.

* Added [named token arguments](docs/author-tokens-guide.md#global-input-arguments).
* Added a universal `|contains=` argument to search token values.
* Added a universal `|inputSeparator=` argument to allow commas in input values using a custom separator.
* Added a `key` argument to `{{Random}}`.
* Added `Loaf` action. Delicious!
* Several [player tokens](docs/author-tokens-guide.md#player) now let you choose whether to check the host player, current player, or both.
* Added `HasConversationTopic` token.
* Reduced trace logs when a mod adds many custom tokens.
* Fixed custom tokens added by other mods able to break Content Patcher in some cases.
* Fixed support for tokens in a `From`/`ToArea`'s `Width` and `Height` fields.
* Fixed support for tokens in a `.json` file loaded through `Action: EditData` with a `FromFile` path containing tokens.
* Fixed format migrations not applied to tokens within JSON objects.
* Fixed multiple input arguments allowed for tokens that only recognize one (like `{{HasFile: fileA.png, fileB.png}}`). Doing so now shows an error.

**Update note for mod authors:**  
Updating the `Format` field to `1.15.0` or later requires changes to your `content.json`. See the [migration guide](docs/author-migration-guide.md) for more info.
