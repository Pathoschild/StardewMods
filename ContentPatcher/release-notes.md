# Release notes
## Upcoming release
* Added new tokens:
  * `LocationName`: the name of the player's current location.
  * `IsOutdoors`: whether the player is outdoors.

* Improved errors when token parsing fails.

Thanks to spacechase0 for contributions to the new token support!

## 1.7
Released 08 May 2019.

* Added new tokens:
  * `HasReadLetter`: whether the player has opened a given mail letter.
  * `HasValue`: whether the input argument is non-blank, like `HasValue:{{spouse}}`.
  * `IsCommunityCenterComplete`: whether all bundles in the community center are completed.
  * `IsMainPlayer`: whether the player is the main player.
* Tokens can now be nested (like `Hearts:{{spouse}}`).
* Tokens can now be used almost everywhere (including dynamic token values, condition values, and `Fields` keys).
* Tokens with multiple values can now be used as placeholders.
* Tokens from `config.json` can now be unrestricted (`AllowValues` is now optional).
* Improved input argument validation.
* Added support for new asset structures in the upcoming Stardew Valley 1.4.
* Fixed incorrect error text when dynamic/config tokens conflict.
* Fixed config schema issues logged as `Debug` instead of `Warning`.
* Removed support for the condition value subkey syntax (like `"Relationship": "Abigail:Married"` instead of `"Relationship:Abigail": "Married"`). This only affects one content pack on Nexus.

**Update note for mod authors:**
* The `ConfigSchema` field changes when you update your format to 1.7:
  * `AllowValues` is no longer required. If you omit it, the config field will allow _any_ value.
  * If you omit `Default`, the default is now blank instead of the first `AllowValues` value.

## 1.6.5
Released 06 April 2019.

* Fixed `EditData` allowing field values containing `/` (which is the field delimiter).
* Fixed error with upcoming SMAPI 3.0 changes.
* Fixed some broken maps in Stardew Valley 1.3.36 not detected.
* Fixed typo in some errors.
* Internal rewriting to support upcoming features.

## 1.6.4
Released 05 March 2019.

* Added detection for most custom maps broken by Stardew Valley 1.3.36 (they'll now be rejected instead of crashing the game).

## 1.6.3
Released 15 January 2019.

* Fixed some conditions not available for multiplayer farmhands after 1.6.2.

## 1.6.2
Released 04 January 2019.

* Conditions are now checked much sooner when loading a save, so early setup like map debris spawning can be affected conditionally.
* Fixed token subkey form not allowed in boolean fields.
* Updated for changes in the upcoming SMAPI 3.0.

## 1.6.1
Released 08 December 2018.

* Fixed error when a content pack has a patch with no `Target` field.
* Fixed some conditions using subkeys marked invalid incorrectly.

## 1.6
Released 08 December 2018.

* Added new tokens:
  * `DaysPlayed`: the number of in-game days played for the current save.
  * `HasWalletItem`: the [special items in the player wallet](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Wallet).
  * `SkillLevel`: the player's level for a given skill.
* Added `Wind` value for `Weather` token.
* Added support for matching subkey/value pairs like `"Relationship": "Abigail:Married, Marnie:Friend"`.
* Added support for conditional map edits (via SMAPI 2.9).
* Added support for editing `Data\NPCDispositions` after the NPC is already created (via SMAPI 2.9).
* Improved performance for most content packs.
* Improved `patch summary` format.
* Updated for the upcoming SMAPI 3.0.
* Fixed language token always marked 'not valid in this context'.
* Fixed token strings not validated for format version compatibility.
* Fixed some 1.5 tokens not validated for format version compatibility.

**Update note for mod authors:**
* The `Weather` token now returns `Wind` on windy days instead of `Sun`. Existing content packs with `"Format": "1.5"` or earlier should work fine, since Content Patcher will adjust their conditions. Content packs which target version 1.6 or later should handle the new weather value.

## 1.5.3
Released 08 November 2018.

* Added `patch summary` hint if `Target` value incorrectly includes a file extension.
* Migrated verbose logs to SMAPI's verbose logging feature.

## 1.5.2
Released 29 September 2018.

* Improved `patch summary` output a bit.
* Fixed another error setting `EditData` entries to `null` since 1.5.

## 1.5.1
Released 23 September 2018.

## 1.5
Released 17 September 2018.
* Added support for dynamic tokens defined by the modder.
* Added new tokens:
  * `FarmCave` (the current farm cave type);
  * `FarmhouseUpgrade` (the upgrade level for the main farmhouse);
  * `FarmName` (the farm name);
  * `FarmType` (the farm type like `Standard` or `Wilderness`);
  * `HasFile` (whether a given file path exists in the content pack);
  * `HasProfession` (whether the player has a given profession);
  * `PlayerGender` (the player's gender);
  * `PlayerName` (the player's name);
  * `PreferredPet` (whether the player is a cat or dog person);

* Added: you can now use tokens in `EditData` entries and fields.
* Added: you can now list multiple values in the `Target` field.
* Added config tokens to `patch summary`.
* Added warning when a config field has `AllowValues` but a patch checks for an unlisted value.
* Removed some early warnings for issues like patch conflicts. That validation required a number of
  restrictions on how conditions and tokens could be used. Based on discussion with content pack
  modders, lifting those restrictions was more valuable than the early validation.
* Removed image preloading, which is no longer needed with SMAPI 2.8+.
* Fixed `patch summary` showing tokens that aren't valid in the current context.
