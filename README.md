**Lookup Anything** is a [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/) mod that shows live info about
whatever's under your cursor when you press `F1`. Learn a villager's favourite gifts, when a crop
will be ready to harvest, how long a fence will last, why your farm animals are unhappy, and more.

Compatible with Stardew Valley 1.11+ on Linux, Mac, and Windows.

2. [Install this mod from Nexus mods](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/541/).

## Configuration
The mod will work fine out of the box, but you can tweak its settings by editing the `config.json`
file if you want. These are the available settings:

| setting           | what it affects
| ----------------- | -------------------
| `Controller`<br />`Keyboard` | Set the controller and keyboard buttons to use (see valid [keyboard buttons](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.xna.framework.input.keys.aspx) and [controller buttons](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.xna.framework.input.buttons.aspx)). The default values are `F1` to lookup, and `Up`/`Down` to scroll the lookup results. Available inputs:<ul><li>`ToggleLookup`: lookup whatever's under the cursor.</li><li>`ToggleLookupInFrontOfPlayer`: lookup whatever's in front of the player.</li><li>`ScrollUp`/`ScrollDown`: scroll the displayed lookup results.</li><li>`ToggleDebug`: show information intended for developers.</li></ul>
| `CheckForUpdates` | Default `true`. Whether the mod should check for a newer version when you load the game. If a new version is available, you'll see a small message at the bottom of the screen for a few seconds. This doesn't affect the load time even if your connection is offline or slow, because it happens in the background.
| `HideOnKeyUp`     | Default `false`. If enabled, the lookup window will be shown while you hold `F1` and disappear when you release it.

## Compiling the mod
[Installing a stable release from Nexus Mods](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/541/) is
recommended for most users. If you really want to compile the mod yourself, read on.

This mod uses the [crossplatform build config](https://github.com/Pathoschild/Stardew.ModBuildConfig#readme)
so it can be built on Linux, Mac, and Windows without changes. See [its documentation](https://github.com/Pathoschild/Stardew.ModBuildConfig#readme)
for troubleshooting.

### Compiling the mod for testing
To compile the mod and add it to the mods directory:

1. Rebuild the project in [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/) or [MonoDevelop](http://www.monodevelop.com/).  
   <small>This will compile the code and package it into the mod directory.</small>
2. Launch the project with debugging.  
   <small>This will start the game through SMAPI and attach the Visual Studio debugger.</small>

### Compiling the mod for release
To package the mod for release:

1. Delete the game's `Mods/LookupAnything` directory.  
   <small>(This ensures the package is clean and has default configuration.)</small>
2. Recompile the mod per the previous section.
3. Launch the game through SMAPI to generate the default `config.json`.
2. Create a zip file of the game's `Mods/LookupAnything` folder. The zip name should include the
   mod name and version. For example:

   ```
   LookupAnything-1.6.zip
      LookupAnything/
         LookupAnything.dll
         LookupAnything.pdb
         data.json
         config.json
         manifest.json
   ```

### Useful tools
These may be useful when working on this mod:

* Windows:
  * [dotPeek](https://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/) to decompile the game into a Visual Studio
  project.
  * [ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) to analyse the game code (e.g. find usages).
  * [XNB Extract](http://community.playstarbound.com/threads/modding-guides-and-general-modding-discussion-redux.109131/)
  to extract the game's assets and data.
