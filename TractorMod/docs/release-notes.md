**How to fix affected saves:**  
The fix isn't retroactive; here's how to fix an existing save if your horse flute summons the
tractor. In multiplayer, this must be done by the main player.

1. _Install [Horse Flute Anywhere](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/7500) 1.1.5 or later._

3. _Run this command in the SMAPI console window:_
   ```
   reset_horses
   ```
4. _That will reset the ownership for **all** horses in the game. Each player should then interact
   with their horse to name it and take ownership._
5. _After saving in-game, you can safely remove Horse Flute Anywhere if you don't need it._
