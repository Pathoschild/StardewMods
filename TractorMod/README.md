(and tractor garage) to more efficiently till/fertilize/seed/water/harvest crops, clear rocks, etc.

Buy a tractor garage from Robin:
> ![](screenshots/buy-garage.png)

...choose where you want it built:
> ![](screenshots/build-garage.png)

...and Robin will build your garage overnight:
> ![](screenshots/final-garage.png)

Now just get on a tractor, choose a tool or seeds or fertilizer, and drive:
> ![](screenshots/tractor.png)

You can do these by default:

hold item  | default effects | optional effects (disabled by default)
---------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------
axe        | clear debris; clear dead crops; cut giant crops. | chop down bushes and trees; clear live crops.
fertilizer | fertilize crops and trees. | —
grass starter | plant grass. | —
hoe        | till dirt; clear weeds; dig artifact spots. | —
melee weapon | clear dead crops; break mine containers. | attack monsters.
milk pail  | collect milk from farm animals. | —
pickaxe    | break rocks; clear tilled dirt; clear dead crops. | break paths/flooring; break placed objects.
scythe     | harvest crops, flowers, bushes, fruit trees, forage; clear weeds and dead crops. | collect machine output.
seeds      | plant seeds in dirt. | —
shears     | shear wool from farm animals. | —
slingshot  | — | shoot one projectile/tile/second in the aimed direction.
watering can | water crops. | —

Tractors use no stamina when using tools, and the watering can won't run out of water. They will
consume fertilizer or seeds when you sow those, though.

## Configure
The mod creates a `config.json` file in its mod folder the first time you run it. You can open that
file in a text editor to configure the mod.

### Global settings
<table>
<tr>
<th>setting</th>
<th>effect</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

`Controls`

</td>
<td>

The configured controller, keyboard, and mouse buttons (see [key bindings](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Key_bindings)).
You can separate multiple buttons with commas. The default keyboard bindings are `Backspace` to
summon a tractor. Available inputs:
* `SummonTractor`: warp an available tractor to your position.
* `DismissTractor`: return the tractor you're riding to its home.
* `HoldToActivate`: if specified, the tractor will only do something while you're holding this
  button. If nothing is specified, the tractor will work automatically while you're riding it.

<td>

`BuildPrice`

</td>

The number of tiles in each direction around the tractor to affect (in addition to the tile under

> ![](screenshots/distance.png)

Default 1, which is a 3 by 3 grid.

**Distance has an exponential impact on performance.** A distance of 15 covers most of the visible
screen; 78 covers the entire vanilla farm map and affects 25K tiles. A value of 15 or less is
recommended to avoid lag.

### Custom tools
The `CustomAttachments` enables custom items/tools while riding the tractor. Tools will be used on
each surrounding tile, while items will be put down. If you specify something that's already
supported (like the axe), this overrides all limitations on its use.

To add an item/tool, specify its exact internal name (not the translated display name). For
example:

```js
"CustomAttachments": ["Axe", "Mega Bomb"]
```

</td>
</tr>


## Custom textures
You can drop new PNGs into the `assets` folder to change the appearance of tractors or garages.
For a seasonal texture, just prefix the name with the season (like `spring_tractor.png`). The mod
will load the seasonal texture if present, else it'll load the default name (like `tractor.png`).

## Compatibility
Tractor Mod is compatible with Stardew Valley 1.4+ on Linux/Mac/Windows, both single-player and
multiplayer.

In multiplayer mode it must be installed by the host player, plus any farmhands who
want to use its features. Farmhands who don't have it installed won't have any issues, they just
won't see the tractor/garage textures or be able to use its features.
